# WIAD Driving Principles
World Information Architecture Day is a one-day annual celebration hosted by the Information Architecture Institute and held in dozens of locations across the world. We are a community of like-minded professionals and enthusiasts who share the common goal of teaching, learning, and shaping the future of Information Architecture. Our driving principles serve as the foundation both of the global event itself and of the local communities that grow from it. 

## WE BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY BUILDING
Our focus is on building local communities of practice within a global network. We recognize that our best chance at reaching our common goals is to foster participation from anyone who may benefit from a better understanding of Information Architecture. To this end, we hold an open-door policy that encourages our greater community to get involved. We hold open planning meetings that anyone may attend, get local businesses involved through targeted event sponsorship, and hold each other accountable for maintaining our spirit of inclusivity.

## WE BELIEVE IN EMPOWERING LEADERS
We have a deep understanding that leaders are created when people are given permission to lead. We remember that we were all new once, and we make space for those that are new today to have the opportunity to succeed. Small or inexperienced communities are enthusiastically welcomed to hold celebrations in their locations, and we provide the support they need to flourish. First-time organizers, speakers,and volunteers are championed as the potential leaders who will carry our event in the future. 

## WE BELIEVE IN GROWING TOGETHER
Humility is our cornerstone, and we recognize each of us as individuals, as well as the field of Information Architecture itself, always has room to grow. We share our thoughts, ideas, and work freely within a framework of openness, with the understanding that advancement depends on collaboration. The content we create is freely available to the public and we invite conversation around the work we’re doing. We seek opportunities to learn from those outside of the field, and ensure that everyone feels welcome to have their voice heard. 

## WE BELIEVE IN GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING
Our community was and continues to be grown from the bottom up. We’ve proven that participation can be achieved through humble means and determination, and that limited resources do not constrain our success. Our accomplishments are dependent on the hard work of volunteers and the generous donations of sponsors. Our events will always be open to everyone and we will always put back into our community what we’ve been given.
